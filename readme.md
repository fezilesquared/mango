Mango API
I have been doing this course [Learn Microservices architecture with .NET Core MVC(.NET 8), Entity Framework Core, .NET Identity with Azure Service Bus](https://www.udemy.com/course/net-core-microservices-the-complete-guide-net-6-mvc/learn/lecture/38027304?start=0#overview)

I lost the code that I had been consistently working on along with the course because my work laptop died. 

This repo begins as a recreation from scratch of that code from scratch. Previously I got up to 
lecture 99 in the course. 
I will make some changes though. Instead of the frontend being .net core razor html I will create a react frontend. 
I intend to use an ai agent as much as possible for the recreation. Since I have some free time until my next job I intend 
to use this project to upskill on ai agents. That will persist until I get bored or fed up with trying to get the ai agent to work. 

LLMs main weakness as of now (09-12-2025) when is comes to coding is hallucination. How I will mitigate this issue is by 
providing the ai agent a structure that it can base it's code on. The structure will be communicated in multitple forms 

- Folder Structure 
- Markdown Files to describe what each folder should do 
- UML Diagrams 
- Unit and Intergration Tests. I will try to do TDD as much as possible(until I get bored of that or frustratred with it 😂)

My first attempt will come be using crush ai agent using the open ai api
